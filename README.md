# speechtotext
Offline speech to text translator using vosk 

This project would not make any API calls and essentially we should be able to get real time speech to text conversion by just using our computer. Three parts to the project :
1. Create Widgets that start and stop recording
2. Use pyaudio to record microphone in background
3. vosk lib for speech recognition --> then add the output to the jupyter widget
